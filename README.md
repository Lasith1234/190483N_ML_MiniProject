AudioMNIST is the dataset used to create the features.
**To both of the notebooks, link the datasets accordingly to proceed.**

Label 1 - Speaker
Label 2 - Age
Label 3 - Gender
Label 4 - Accent
These would be the labels that needed to be predicted with a suggested ML model using the featured provided through the dataset.

The model has been trained to classify each of the labels in different ways in order to get the highest accuracy in prediction.

Mostly PCA, svm classifiers, Hyper parameter tuning using halving techniques, random forest, catboost and various other techniques has been used in training the model.

Seperate csv files have been generated to each of the labels and are combined together. In the end, these files are been combined in the form specified according to the kaggle competition guide lines.

CSV files are generated according to the methodology that gives the highest accuracy values for each label prediction
